## 🧠 What is the Dark Web?

The **Dark Web** is a part of the internet that is **intentionally hidden** and requires special software (like Tor or I2P) to access.  

It is often confused with the **Deep Web**, but they are not the same:  

| Layer           | What It Is                             | Example                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 🌐 Surface Web   | Public internet, indexed by search engines. | Google, Wikipedia, news websites.        |
| 🌊 Deep Web      | Unindexed but benign content.           | Medical records, private emails, paywalls.|
| 🌑 Dark Web      | Hidden sites, anonymous access only.    | .onion websites, black markets, forums.  |

> 🗝️ *Think of the internet like an iceberg: Surface Web (visible tip), Deep Web (submerged bulk), Dark Web (the deepest, most hidden layer).*
