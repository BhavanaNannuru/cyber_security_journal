## 🧠 What is IoT?

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to everyday devices connected to the internet:  
- 📱 Smart speakers (Alexa, Google Home)  
- 🏠 Smart thermostats & cameras  
- 🚗 Connected cars  
- 🏥 Medical devices  

These devices collect, send, and receive data—often without much built-in security.

## 🚨 Why Are IoT Devices Risky?

- 🔓 **Weak Default Passwords**  
  Many devices ship with default credentials like `admin/admin`.  

- 🚫 **Lack of Updates**  
  IoT manufacturers rarely provide patches for vulnerabilities.  

- 🌐 **Massive Attack Surface**  
  Each connected device is a potential doorway for hackers.  

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Data Privacy Risks**  
  Devices collect sensitive personal data (location, health stats, etc.).

## 🔥 Real-World Case

**Mirai Botnet (2016)**  
- Malware infected IoT devices like routers & cameras.  
- Created a massive botnet that launched one of the **largest DDoS attacks ever**.  
- Took down sites like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit.

## ✅ How to Secure IoT Devices

1. **Change Default Credentials Immediately**  
2. **Keep Devices Updated** (if vendor provides patches).  
3. **Use a Separate Network** for IoT (e.g., guest Wi-Fi).  
4. **Disable Unused Features** (like remote access).  
5. **Choose Trusted Brands** with a track record of security.  
6. **Monitor Network Traffic** for unusual activity.
