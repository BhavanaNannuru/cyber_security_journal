### 💥 What is Malware?

Malware = **Malicious Software**.  
It’s software built to **disrupt**, **steal**, **spy**, or **control** systems — silently or aggressively.

---

### 🔥 Common Malware Types

- **Virus** → Attaches to files, spreads when opened  
- **Worm** → Spreads across networks automatically  
- **Trojan** → Looks legit, but opens the door to attackers  
- **Ransomware** → Encrypts files, demands money  
- **Spyware** → Secretly records activity (keystrokes, webcams)  
- **Adware** → Pushes popups, slows performance  
- **Rootkit** → Hides deep in OS, gives attacker admin control

### 📡 How Malware Spreads

- Infected email attachments  
- Cracked or fake software downloads  
- USB drives  
- Exploiting system vulnerabilities  
- Fake websites and pop-ups  
- Macros in Office files

### 🔬 Malware in Action (Real Cases)

- **WannaCry (2017)**  
  Used EternalBlue exploit (Windows)  
  Locked hospital, company files worldwide  
  Demanded Bitcoin ransom  

- **NotPetya (2017)**  
  Looked like ransomware — was actually data-wiping malware  
  Crippled major infrastructure in Ukraine and beyond  

- **Emotet**  
  Trojan that evolved into a malware delivery platform  

---

### 🛡️ How Malware Hides

- **Obfuscation**: Scrambles code  
- **Polymorphism**: Changes form each run  
- **Code Injection**: Runs inside trusted processes  
- **Bootkits/Rootkits**: Load before or inside OS kernel

- ✅ Use trusted antivirus + real-time scanning  
- ✅ Enable firewall
