## 🧠 How Can Speakers and External Devices Be Exploited?

Speakers and other peripherals (USBs, webcams, headphones) seem harmless, but hackers have found creative ways to use them in attacks:  

- 🔊 **Speaker-Based Attacks**  
  Emit ultrasonic sounds (inaudible to humans) to control voice assistants or exfiltrate data.  

- 🖇️ **Compromised Peripherals**  
  Infected USB drives or devices can introduce malware into your system.  

- 🎙️ **Microphone Hijacking**  
  Hackers turn on microphones via speakers to eavesdrop.

## 🔥 Real-World Example

- **DolphinAttack (2017)**  
  - Used **inaudible ultrasonic commands** to trick Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant into executing tasks like opening websites or sending texts.  

- **BadUSB (2014)**  
  - Modified USB firmware turned ordinary devices into hacking tools capable of stealing data or installing malware.

## 🚨 Why Are External Devices Vulnerable?

- 🛠️ **Default Trust**  
  Systems often trust external devices automatically.  

- 🔓 **No User Awareness**  
  Users rarely suspect a mouse, speaker, or charger could be malicious.  

- 🌐 **Plug-and-Play Convenience**  
  Makes exploitation easier for attackers.

## ✅ How to Protect Against Such Threats

1. 🛡️ **Disable Auto-Run Features**  
   - Prevents automatic execution of malicious code.  

2. 🚫 **Avoid Unknown Devices**  
   - Never plug in untrusted USBs or peripherals.  

3. 🔊 **Harden Voice Assistants**  
   - Disable always-listening features or use wake-word confirmation.  

4. 🧑‍💻 **Use Device Control Policies**  
   - Restrict which external devices can connect to critical systems.  

5. 🔒 **Keep Firmware Updated**  
   - Speakers and peripherals may get security updates too.
