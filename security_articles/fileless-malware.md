## 📌 Topic: Fileless Malware – The Invisible Threat That Lives in Memory

> “Fileless malware doesn’t write malicious code to disk—it lives entirely in memory, making it nearly impossible to detect.”

## 🧠 What is Fileless Malware?

Fileless malware is a stealthy cyberattack that resides only in **RAM (volatile memory)**.  
✅ It leverages trusted system tools like PowerShell and WMI.  
✅ It avoids leaving files on disk, bypassing traditional antivirus detection.  

> 🗝️ *Think of it like a thief who enters your house, steals valuables, and leaves without unlocking or breaking anything.*

## 🛠️ How Fileless Malware Works

1. **Initial Access**  
   - Delivered via phishing links or software exploits.  

2. **Living off the Land**  
   - Executes malicious commands using built-in system tools instead of dropping binaries.  

3. **Persistence**  
   - May use registry keys or scheduled tasks to reload payloads directly into memory.

## 🔥 Real-World Examples

- **Kovter Trojan** – Spread through malvertising campaigns, remained memory-resident.  
- **POSHSPY** – Leveraged PowerShell scripts to steal sensitive data.  
- **Equifax Breach** – Attackers used fileless techniques to exploit vulnerabilities.

## 🚨 Why Fileless Malware is Dangerous

- 🕵️‍♂️ Evades traditional antivirus scans because there are no disk artifacts.  
- ⚡ Executes rapidly in memory, often disappearing on reboot.  
- 🎯 Frequently used in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) targeting enterprises.

## ✅ How to Defend Against Fileless Malware

- 🛡️ **Deploy EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)** to monitor memory behavior.  
- 🔒 **Restrict use of PowerShell and WMI** to signed scripts only.  
- 📜 Apply **least privilege principles** for user and admin accounts.  
- 🔄 Patch all software and OS vulnerabilities regularly.  
- 📶 Monitor network traffic for suspicious outbound connections.
