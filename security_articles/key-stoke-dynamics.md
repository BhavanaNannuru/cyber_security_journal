## 🧠 What is Keystroke Dynamics?

**Keystroke Dynamics** studies how a person types on a keyboard:  
- ⏱️ Speed between keystrokes (latency)  
- 🖱️ Pressure on keys  
- 🖋️ Typing patterns (like holding Shift or Backspace)  

Hackers can use this data to:  
✅ **Guess passwords**  
✅ **Impersonate users**  
✅ Perform **side-channel attacks** to learn sensitive information.  

> 🗝️ *Think of it like your typing style being a digital fingerprint.*

## 🚨 How Can Typing Patterns Be Exploited?

1. 🖥️ **Keylogging Malware**  
   - Captures keystrokes & timings for password guessing.  

2. 🎙️ **Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks**  
   - Uses microphone recordings of keystroke sounds to reconstruct what you typed.  

3. 📡 **Electromagnetic Emanations**  
   - Reads tiny EM signals emitted by keyboards to recover keystrokes.  

4. 🎥 **Video Analysis**  
   - Observes finger movements on video to deduce inputs.

## 🔥 Real-World Case

- **Acoustic Snooping Attack (UC Berkeley, 2004)**  
  Researchers used recorded typing sounds to identify keys with **96% accuracy** on standard keyboards.  

- **AI-Powered Typing Reconstruction (2023)**  
  Machine learning models trained on typing sounds could recover passwords from Zoom calls.

## ✅ How to Defend Against Typing Pattern Exploits

1. 🔒 **Use Virtual Keyboards**  
   - Reduces reliance on physical keystrokes for sensitive entries.  

2. 🎧 **Sound Masking**  
   - Play background noise or white noise to obscure keystroke sounds.  

3. 🛡️ **Keep Devices Secure**  
   - Prevent malware that captures keystrokes.  

4. 🧑‍💻 **Adopt MFA**  
   - Even if a password is guessed, MFA blocks access.  

5. 🔄 **Change Passwords Frequently**  
   - Limits window of opportunity for attackers.
