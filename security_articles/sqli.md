### 🧠 What is a Brute Force Attack?

A **Brute Force Attack** is a trial-and-error method used by attackers to crack:  

- 🔑 Passwords  
- 🔐 Encryption keys  
- 🔓 PINs  

The attacker systematically tries **all possible combinations** until the correct one is found.

### 🛠️ Types of Brute Force Attacks

- **Simple Brute Force**  
  Tries *every possible combination*.  
  ⚡ Slow for long, complex passwords.  

- **Dictionary Attack**  
  Uses a pre-made list of common passwords.  
  (e.g., “123456”, “password”)  

- **Hybrid Attack**  
  Combines dictionary + random variations.  
  (e.g., password123, P@ssw0rd!)  

- **Credential Stuffing**  
  Uses stolen username-password pairs from previous breaches.

### 🧠 Real-World Case

- **2012 Dropbox Hack**  
  Attackers used credentials leaked from another site in a **brute force-style credential stuffing attack**, compromising over **68 million accounts**.

---

### ✅ How to Defend Against Brute Force

- 🛡️ **Strong Passwords**: Long, complex, and unique for every account.  
- 🔄 **Rate Limiting**: Lock accounts after failed login attempts.  
- 📱 **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Even if password is guessed, login requires second factor.  
- 🔒 Use **CAPTCHAs** to block automated bots.  
- 🧪 Monitor for **suspicious login attempts**.
