# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Daily — Day 7

## 📌 Topic: DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

> “DDoS attacks flood servers with traffic, causing systems to slow or crash.”

---

### 🚨 How It Works

1. Botnets = zombie devices controlled by attackers  
2. Massive traffic floods target server/network  
3. Service becomes unavailable for real users  

---

### 🔥 Types of DDoS

- **Volumetric** → Consumes bandwidth  
- **Protocol Attacks** → Exploits server resources  
- **Application Layer** → Targets specific apps (e.g., HTTP floods)  

---

### 🧠 Real Case: GitHub 2018

- Largest DDoS (1.35 Tbps traffic)  
- Mitigated in 10 min using Cloudflare  

---

### ✅ Defense Tips

- Rate limiting + traffic filtering  
- Use CDNs & anti-DDoS services  
- Monitor traffic for anomalies
