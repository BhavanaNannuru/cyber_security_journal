# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Daily — Day 5

## 📌 Topic: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

> “2FA = Password + Something else. It blocks most attacks — even if your password leaks.”

---

### 🔐 Factor Types

- **Something you know** → Password  
- **Something you have** → Phone/token  
- **Something you are** → Biometrics  

---

### 🧰 Common Methods

- Authenticator apps (Google Auth, Authy)  
- Push notifications  
- Hardware tokens (YubiKey)  
- SMS/Email OTPs (use cautiously)

---

### 🎯 Real Case: Twitter 2020 Breach

- Some accounts survived because they had 2FA enabled  
- 2FA stopped attackers even after credentials were stolen

---

### ✅ Security Tips

- Always enable 2FA on key accounts  
- Prefer apps or hardware over SMS  
- Use backup codes & store them securely
