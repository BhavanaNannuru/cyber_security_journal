# Day 1 – Uff!! Did it!
📅 Date: 7 June 2025  
Looks too much to go through. Can understand what I'm reading. I also feel I'm missing something along the way. Day 1 bricks laid, more to go!

 # Day 2 – Easy!
📅 Date: 8 June 2025  
It was a pretty easy job today. Needed to install vmware and debian. Rest of the tools were already installed by default! Job done perfect! Look's like the 2nd brick is laid down pretty firmly!

 # Day 3 – Did Something!
📅 Date: 9 June 2025  
Feels like I have done something, a step closer but yet not that big. Probably because am still taking the intial steps. Planning to lay foundations stronger. Looking forward to tomorrow. 

# Day 4 - Getting the hang of it!
📅 Date: 10 June 2025  
This was the most satisfying day ever! Completed 4 owasp practice labs in under an hr! The sense of belongingness is ddeply cultivated. 

# Day 5 - That's LINUX!!
📅 Date: 11 June 2025  
Woow! I did see a lot of commands there. Bash Scripting peaked my smiles. HEHE!! 

# Day 6 – Google it like a Hacker!
📅 Date: 12 June 2025  
Today was all about Google Dorking and search skills. It felt like being a detective with a search bar. Who knew typing smart stuff in Google could make you feel like Neo? Really loved this one — sneaky and smart! :)

# Day 7 – I Can Spy Too!
📅 Date: 13 June 2025  
Passive reconnaissance made me feel like a total spy without even touching the target! The tools were simple but powerful. Shodan was like opening a dark magic portal. One word — exhilarating!

# Day 8 – Defender Mode: Activated!
📅 Date: 14 June 2025  
Switched to blue team today. Felt like I was locking virtual doors and building digital walls. Not flashy, but I felt the responsibility. Defense is honestly underrated. I think I like being on both sides.

# Day 9 – So Many Roles, So Many Roads!
📅 Date: 15 June 2025  
Breathed in the big picture today. Cybersecurity has so many flavors — SOC, pentesting, GRC, forensics! It was overwhelming, but in a good way. Still figuring out where I’ll land, but hey — I’ve started walking!

# Day 10 – I Speak Regex Now!
📅 Date: 16 June 2025  
Regular expressions felt like black magic in the beginning. But once it clicked... it *clicked*! Finally cracked a few patterns on my own. Felt like decoding alien signals, lol.

# Day 11 – Oh... They Do That!?
📅 Date: 17 June 2025  
Common attacks = real-world jaw-drops. Some of these tactics are so simple yet scary. I kept thinking "Damn, people actually fall for this?" Respect to defenders who deal with this daily.

# Day 12 – Hack the Planet (with Metadata!)
📅 Date: 18 June 2025  
Malware was a horror story, and geolocating images? That was straight up Sherlock Holmes. Never thought EXIF data could leak *so* much. My phone settings need a rethink after today 😳.

# Day 13 – Mindset Shift
📅 Date: 19 June 2025  
Took a step back to understand the landscape again. Cybersecurity is big. But now it’s less scary and more inviting. Feeling like a tourist who’s just got a map and good shoes.

# Day 14 – Python, Hello Old Friend!
📅 Date: 20 June 2025  
Revisited Python today. Smooth sailing. Like meeting a school buddy after years and realizing you still vibe. Happy to bring code into the cyber world again!

# Day 15 – DNS Demystified!
📅 Date: 21 June 2025  
DNS always felt like a dusty backroom of the internet. But today, I opened that door! Wasn’t spooky — actually fascinating. Can’t believe how much info DNS leaks 👀.

# Day 16 – CSI: Terminal Edition
📅 Date: 22 June 2025  
Digital Forensics felt like an episode of CSI... except it’s me, on the keyboard, tracing deleted files and timestamps. Low-key loved it. Might explore this field more later!

# Day 17 – Shift Left, Stay Sharp
📅 Date: 23 June 2025  
DevSecOps = developers who grew up and got paranoid 😆 Secure pipelines, automated scans... it’s like giving developers their own vault door. Clean, technical, and kinda beautiful.

# Day 18 – Crypto: The Real One
📅 Date: 24 June 2025  
I’m not talking Bitcoin here! Finally understood cryptographic basics today. Hashing, symmetric keys... so many buzzwords finally got some meaning. Encryption suddenly feels logical, not mystical.

# Day 19 – Caesar, You’re Cute
📅 Date: 25 June 2025  
Played with Caesar cipher, XOR, Base64 — felt like solving baby puzzles, but fun ones! These tiny crypto tricks made me think how clever even old-school attackers were.

# Day 20 – OSI Be Like: “Layered like Cake”
📅 Date: 26 June 2025  
Networking 101 again. OSI model is starting to feel natural. Ports, packets, protocols — all lining up now. I’ve seen these in Wireshark, but now I *understand* them! Finally took a breather to log all this madness. GitHub journal catching up, scripts coming soon. It feels GOOD to document. This journey is mine — raw, messy, and real!

# Day 21 – Brain Fry Day!
📅 Date: 27 June 2025  
Worked all day today. Though most of brain traffic went towards GitHub profile page setup, some routed from tryhackme too! :)
Loved the day: exhausting but due to something that i like to do. Moving forward with great spirits for tomorrow!!

# Day 22 – Sync It Up, Captain!
📅 Date: 28 June 2025  
Found out I missed a 'date' somewhere 🥲. Uploading tomorrow's today itself because of that! Oops!!!
Added the correct day too!!! Keep moving :)

# Day 23 – Hanging Coder, hang on!!
📅 Date: 29 June 2025  
Did something that pulls my interest and deserves my attention all the time! My baby, python code as generally referred to, held me all along today!! Interests peaked, time vanished and letters appeared.

# Day 24 – Felt a lil bit slow today!
📅 Date: 30 June 2025 
Wish I could tell that I'm done with my targets today. Barely passed, having said that: BREAK is important too!

# 💭 Day 25 – Phish, Shells & Realizations  
📅 Date: 1 July 2025
Some days feel slower but they carry deep weight. Today was that. Let's see what we have tmr!


# Day 26 – Eye Opener  
📅 Date: 2 July 2025
Realized how powerful 2FA truly is. CVE-2018-11776 blew my mind — one tiny misconfig, full server pwn. Security is no joke.


# Day 27 – Unfiltered  
📅 Date: 3 July 2025
BlueKeep made me realize how dangerous unpatched systems can be. VPNs felt like a magic cloak for data — now I get why they’re so hyped.

# Day 28 – Floods & Exploits!  
📅 Date: 4 July 2025
Whoa! Today felt heavy but exciting. 💥 DDoS attacks are like digital tsunamis—learning how they cripple systems was wild. Also, CVE-2017-5638? Damn, that tiny header bug wrecked Equifax! 😳 Makes me realize how one oversight can burn down even giants. Slowly feeling like I'm connecting all the dots in this journey.  


# Day 29 – Feeling Like a Real Pentester  
📅 Date: 5 July 2025  
Woah, today was all about *planning and discovery*! The passive recon part felt like detective work—sneaking around with WHOIS and social media. Active recon got me hyped too; ping sweeps and DNS enumeration gave me a sense of *"mapping enemy territory."* 😎 Definitely feels like I’m stepping into the real pentester mindset now.  


# Day 30 – Feeling Like a Pentester  
📅 Date: 6 July 2025 
Woah… today felt like connecting so many dots! 🧠 I finally understood how all the **pen testing phases** fit together—like planning, attacking, and then neatly cleaning up like nothing happened 😏. Also, crypto fundamentals hit differently this time… symmetric, asymmetric, hashes—feels like I can finally “see” how they’re used in real life. 🛡️ 
The more I dig in, the more exciting (and slightly scary) this field feels.  


# Day 31 – 🚀 Feeling pumped! 
📅 Date: 7 July 2025 
Cracked a Wireshark challenge and started building my own web vulnerability scanner – this is starting to feel real! 


# Day 32 – Focused yet curious! 
📅 Date: 8 July 2025 
Wrapped up the Pomodoro app basics, modularized the web vuln scanner, and went deep into Python modules—feeling like pieces are falling into place.
