ðŸ“… Date: 8 June 2025

## âœ… Tools Installed
Today, I set up and tested three essential cybersecurity tools in Debian that will be used extensively in upcoming hands-on labs, vulnerability assessments, and automation projects:

1. **Wireshark** â€“ Network traffic analysis tool  
2. **Nmap** â€“ Network scanning and enumeration utility  
3. **Burp Suite (Community Edition)** â€“ Web application testing suite

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts & Observations
All the tools were pre-installed with Kali. Latest versions too.
