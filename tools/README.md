# 🛠 Cybersecurity Tools – Planned Exploration & Notes

This folder will contain practical notes, usage guides, command summaries, and observations from my hands-on experience with commonly used cybersecurity tools. Each tool will have a dedicated markdown file once I begin working with it.

## 🎯 Goal

To build technical confidence and fluency in real-world cybersecurity tools that are widely used for scanning, sniffing, exploitation, analysis, and defense. I aim to understand not just how to run them — but when, why, and in what context.

## 🧪 Tools I Plan to Explore

| Tool        | Category             | Plan |
|-------------|----------------------|------|
| Wireshark   | Packet analysis      | Start with basic filters, capture logs |
| Nmap        | Network scanning     | Try scans on local machines, ports |
| Metasploit  | Exploitation framework | Learn payload structure, test on labs |
| Burp Suite  | Web app security     | Intercept requests, test login bypass |
| Snort       | Intrusion detection  | Rule syntax, detect alerts |
| Nikto       | Vulnerability scanning | Run against demo web servers |

## 📄 For Each Tool (once done), I'll Document:

- What the tool is used for
- How I installed/set it up
- Common commands and use-cases
- Screenshots of results (where possible)
- Personal reflections or gotchas

## 🔜 Status

🟡 Tools planned — logs and insights will begin appearing here as I progress through my 45-day challenge.
