# Cybersecurity Tools â€“ Planned Exploration & Notes

This folder will contain practical notes, usage guides, command summaries, and observations from my hands-on experience with commonly used cybersecurity tools. Each tool will have a dedicated markdown file once I begin working with it.

## Goal

To build technical confidence and fluency in real-world cybersecurity tools that are widely used for scanning, sniffing, exploitation, analysis, and defense. I aim to understand not just how to run them â€” but when, why, and in what context.

## Tools I Plan to Explore (Got the list written using web)

| Tool        | Category             | Plan |
|-------------|----------------------|------|
| Wireshark   | Packet analysis      | Start with basic filters, capture logs |
| Nmap        | Network scanning     | Try scans on local machines, ports |
| Metasploit  | Exploitation framework | Learn payload structure, test on labs |
| Burp Suite  | Web app security     | Intercept requests, test login bypass |
| Snort       | Intrusion detection  | Rule syntax, detect alerts |
| Nikto       | Vulnerability scanning | Run against demo web servers |  
and many more ...

## ðŸ“„ For Each Tool (once done), I'll try to document:

- What the tool is used for
- How I installed/set it up
- Common commands and use-cases
- Screenshots of results (where possible)
- Personal reflections or gotchas

## Status

Tools planned â€” logs and insights will begin appearing here as I progress :)
