## ✅ Activities Completed

### 🔐 OWASP Top 10 – Practical Labs (TryHackMe)  
**Room:** [OWASP Top 10 (2021)](https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop102021)  

- **A02: Cryptographic Failures**
  - Cracked MD5 hash using [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net)
  - Learned the importance of using strong hashing algorithms and salting passwords.

- **A03: Injection**
  - Performed command injection by modifying URL input using `$(command)`
  - Observed how unsanitized input can lead to command execution on the server.

- **A04: Insecure Design**
  - Understood poor design choices like guessable security questions and weak OTP mechanisms.
  - Reviewed Instagram’s 6-digit OTP example and how weak rate limiting (e.g., 250 requests/IP) is exploitable.

- **A05: Security Misconfiguration**
  - Studied the 2015 Patreon case involving public backups.
  - Simulated misconfiguration using Python’s interactive shell in a web environment.

- **A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components (Partial)**
  - Learned how attackers often leverage known exploits for outdated software.
  - Finished the reading; lab pending for tomorrow.

## 🧠 Python Fundamentals – Deep Revision

- Reviewed core topics:
  - Data types and type casting
  - Control structures: `if`, `for`, `while`
  - Function definitions and return handling
  - Built-ins: `enumerate()`, `zip()`, `sorted()`, etc.
  - Exception handling: `try`, `except`, `finally`
  - List/dictionary/set comprehensions
  - File I/O using `with open()`

✅ Solidified foundational Python skills for upcoming cybersecurity scripting tasks.

## 🗂️ Deferred to Day 5

- Burp Suite Hands-On:
  - Proxy configuration
  - Request interception
  - Repeater practice

- Python Script:
  - Simple Port Scanner (`day04_port_scanner.py`)

**Status:**  
🎯 Progressing steadily with OWASP and Python fundamentals.  
🔧 Ready to tackle tool-based tasks and scripting integration tomorrow.
