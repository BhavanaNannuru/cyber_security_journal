📅 Date: 16 July 2025  

---

## 🧠 **Facial Recognition in Cybersecurity**  
- 🎯 **Definition**: Biometric authentication technique that identifies or verifies a person using their facial features.  
- 🛡️ **Applications in Security**:  
  - 📱 Mobile device authentication (Face ID, Android Face Unlock).  
  - 🏢 Physical access control in secure facilities.  
  - 🎥 Surveillance systems to detect unauthorized individuals.  
  - ✈️ Airport security (e.g., biometric boarding gates).  
- ⚠️ **Risks & Challenges**:  
  - Privacy concerns: Collection & storage of biometric data.  
  - Spoofing attacks (e.g., 3D masks, deepfakes).  
  - Algorithmic bias: False positives/negatives in certain demographics.  
- 🛡️ **Mitigations**:  
  - Use liveness detection to prevent spoofing.  
  - Encrypt and securely store biometric templates.  
  - Regular algorithm audits for fairness and accuracy.
