# Day 36 – IoT Risks & CVE Insights  
📅 Date: 12 July 2025  

🛡️ **CVE-2017-11882 (Microsoft Office Equation Editor)**  
- A memory corruption vulnerability in the Equation Editor component of Microsoft Office.  
- Attackers exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code remotely without significant user interaction.  
- Widely used in spear-phishing attacks to deliver malware payloads.  
- Highlights the importance of patching legacy components and disabling unnecessary features.  

📡 **IoT Security Risks**  
- **Weak/Default Credentials**: Many IoT devices ship with insecure default usernames and passwords.  
- **Outdated Firmware**: Lack of updates leaves devices exposed to known exploits.  
- **Network Exposure**: Devices directly accessible from the internet are prime targets for attackers.  
- **Botnets (e.g., Mirai)**: Compromised IoT devices used in massive DDoS attacks.  
- **Best Practices**:  
  - Change default credentials immediately.  
  - Keep firmware up to date.  
  - Segment IoT devices on a separate network.  
  - Disable unnecessary services to reduce the attack surface.
