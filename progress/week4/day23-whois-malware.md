# 🗓️ Day 23 – June 29, 2025
## 🔥 Daily Cybersecurity Journal

### ✅ Completed Today

- 🧠 **Revised Pentesting Fundamentals**
  - Black-box, white-box, and grey-box testing methods
  - Common pentest stages: Reconnaissance → Scanning → Exploitation → Post-exploitation → Reporting
  - Methodologies: NIST, OSSTMM, OWASP

- 🦠 **Malware Overview**
  - Studied types: Virus, Worm, Trojan, Ransomware, Spyware, Keyloggers, Rootkits, Logic Bombs
  - Understood propagation methods and payload types

- 🛠️ **Built: WHOIS Domain Threat Analyzer**
  - Custom-built Python tool for domain lookup and threat scoring
  - Implemented:
    - CLI using `argparse`
    - Batch scanning & single domain support
    - Threat scoring heuristics
    - Color-coded CLI output with `colorama`
    - CSV export support
  - Laid groundwork for future extensions (blacklist check, reverse IP lookup, visual reports)

### 🧠 Concepts Revised

- WHOIS metadata parsing
- Python modules: `whois`, `argparse`, `csv`, `colorama`
- Threat modeling logic using heuristics
- Malware classification and behavioral traits
- Penetration testing strategies and assessment techniques

### 📌 Notes Summary (Quick Revision)

#### 💻 Pentesting Types
- **Black-box**: No internal access
- **White-box**: Full access
- **Grey-box**: Partial knowledge

#### 🦠 Malware Types
- **Virus**: Needs host to replicate
- **Worm**: Self-replicating
- **Trojan**: Disguised malicious software
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts files, demands ransom
- **Spyware/Keyloggers**: Stealthy information theft
- **Rootkits**: Hide presence of malware

### 🧰 WHOIS Tool Features Recap
- Threat score from WHOIS metadata
- Color-coded CLI output
- Supports batch and single scans
- Custom CSV export
- Modular and extensible
