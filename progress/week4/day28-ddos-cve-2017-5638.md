# Day 28 – 🛡️ Deep Dive: DDoS Attacks & CVE-2017-5638  
📅 Date: 4 July 2025  

## 🌐 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks  

A **DDoS attack** attempts to disrupt normal traffic of a server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic from multiple sources.  

### 🔥 **Key Characteristics**
- **Distributed**: Uses a botnet (network of compromised devices) to amplify attack power.  
- **Difficult to Block**: Traffic comes from legitimate-looking IPs across the globe.  

### 📊 **Types of DDoS Attacks**
1. **Volumetric Attacks**
   - Objective: Saturate the target’s bandwidth.  
   - Examples: UDP Floods, ICMP (Ping) Floods, DNS Amplification.  

2. **Protocol Attacks**
   - Objective: Exploit protocol weaknesses to exhaust server resources.  
   - Examples: SYN Floods (TCP handshake abuse), Ping of Death, Smurf attacks.  

3. **Application Layer Attacks**
   - Objective: Overwhelm specific applications or services.  
   - Examples: HTTP GET/POST Floods, Slowloris (opens many partial HTTP connections).  

### 🛡️ **Defensive Strategies**
- Rate limiting & traffic filtering.  
- Deploy **WAF (Web Application Firewalls)** and **CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai)**.  
- Use DDoS mitigation platforms to absorb and scrub malicious traffic.  
- Monitor traffic patterns for anomaly detection.

## 🛡️ CVE-2017-5638 – Apache Struts2 Remote Code Execution  

### 📝 **Overview**
- A **critical RCE vulnerability** in Apache Struts2 (a popular Java web framework).  
- Vulnerability in the **Jakarta Multipart Parser** allowed attackers to send malicious `Content-Type` HTTP headers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.  

### 💥 **Real-World Impact**
- **Equifax Breach (2017)**: Personal data of ~148 million users stolen due to this exploit.  
- Attackers uploaded web shells for persistence after initial compromise.  

### 🛠️ **Attack Methodology**
1. Craft malicious HTTP request with a specially designed `Content-Type` header.  
2. Apache Struts2 evaluates OGNL expressions in headers without proper sanitization.  
3. Remote code gets executed on the server.  

### ✅ **Mitigation**
- Upgrade Apache Struts2 to patched versions.  
- Apply **Input Validation** and avoid dynamic evaluation of user-supplied data.  
- Use security scanners to detect unpatched instances.

## 📌 **Key Takeaways**
- 🚨 DDoS attacks target availability; CVE-2017-5638 targets confidentiality & integrity.  
- **Lesson:** Always patch critical software promptly and design layered defenses.
