# 🛡️ Day 45 – Fileless Malware & Linux Kernel SCTP Vulnerability  
📅 Date: 21 July 2025  

### 🚨 CVE-2025-60321 (Linux Kernel – SCTP Use-After-Free)  
- **Type**: Use-after-free vulnerability in SCTP protocol implementation.  
- **Impact**: Remote attackers could exploit crafted SCTP packets to gain **local privilege escalation** or cause **DoS**.  
- **Affected**: Linux Kernel v5.10 to v6.5.  
- **Patch**: Released July 20, 2025 (merged into stable branches).  

### 🦠 Fileless Malware  
- **Definition**: Malware that resides in memory and avoids writing files to disk.  
- **Techniques**: Uses PowerShell, WMI, and registry for persistence.  
- **Challenges**: Evades traditional antivirus as no signature is left on disk.  
- **Defense**:  
  - Implement EDR tools with behavioral detection.  
  - Monitor memory for suspicious process injections.  
  - Harden PowerShell with constrained language mode.
