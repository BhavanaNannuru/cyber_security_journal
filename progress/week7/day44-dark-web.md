## 🌐 Dark Web: Insights & Security Challenges  

- **What is the Dark Web?**  
  - A part of the internet not indexed by search engines, accessed via tools like **Tor** or **I2P**.  
  - Commonly used for **anonymity**, but also a hub for **illicit activities**.  

- **Risks to Cybersecurity**  
  - 🕵️‍♂️ **Threat Actor Marketplaces**: Selling exploits, credentials, malware kits.  
  - 📥 **Data Breaches for Sale**: Leaked databases traded among cybercriminals.  
  - 🎭 **Anonymity**: Makes attribution of attacks extremely difficult.  

- **Defense Techniques**  
  - ⚡ Continuous monitoring of dark web forums for leaked organizational data.  
  - 🕸️ Threat Intelligence feeds to identify emerging exploits and zero-days.  
  - 🚫 Educating users to avoid phishing links leading to onion domains.
