# Day 30 – Pen Testing Phases & Crypto Refresh  
📅 Date: 6 July 2025  

🛡️ **Penetration Testing Phases**  
- ✅ **Planning**: Defined scope, rules of engagement, legal considerations, and risk assessment.  
- ✅ **Discovery**: Passive recon (WHOIS, OSINT, social media) and active recon (port scanning, banner grabbing).  
- ✅ **Attack**: Gaining access using exploits and privilege escalation.  
- ✅ **Verification**: Confirmed vulnerabilities and validated exploitability.  
- ✅ **Cleanup & Reporting**: Removed traces, restored systems, and prepared actionable reports.  

🔐 **Cryptography Refresher**  
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Single shared key (e.g., AES, DES).  
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Public/private key pairs (e.g., RSA, ECC).  
- **Hashing**: One-way functions (SHA, MD5).  
- **Digital Signatures & Certificates**: Ensuring integrity and authentication.  

📌 **Highlight**: Connected how crypto supports secure communication and how pentesters leverage it to exploit or secure systems.
