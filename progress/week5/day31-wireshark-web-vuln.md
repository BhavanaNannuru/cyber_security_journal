# Day 32 – Wireshark Practice & Vulnerability Scanner 🚀  
📅 Date: 7 July 2025  

### 🕵️‍♂️ **Wireshark Analysis (THM Challenge)**  
- Completed a TryHackMe challenge focusing on **packet capture and analysis**.  
- Practiced identifying protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP handshakes).  
- Traced suspicious traffic patterns and extracted key insights from PCAP files.  
- Strengthened ability to filter and analyze network traffic for **web attacks** and reconnaissance activities.  

### 🐍 **New Python Project: Web Vulnerability Scanner**  
- Began working on a custom web vulnerability scanner tool.  
- ✅ Wrote `crawler.py` to recursively crawl a given domain for links and assets.  
- Planned to integrate scanner modules for common web vulnerabilities (*XSS, SQLi, open directories*).  
- Applied **modular design** for scalability.  

### 🌟 **Key Takeaways**  
- Gained hands-on confidence with **Wireshark filters** and packet inspection.  
- Laid the groundwork for a **portfolio-worthy security automation project**.
